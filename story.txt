at the memorial union. It was raining outisde and it seemed like the 
perfect day to be working on the project.

Then out of nowhere...

A bunch of students went running by sprinting as fast as possible. As jack looked up he saw a giant alein space ship in the sky. "I got to get out of here" Jack thought.

This is my story file for CS400 x2

The day before a big project was due, jack was slowly making progress
at the memorial union. It was raining outisde and it seemed like the 
perfect day to be working on the project.

Then out of nowhere...

A bunch of students went running by sprinting as fast as possible. As jack looked up he saw a giant alein space ship in the sky. "I got to get out of here" Jack thought. 

he quickly slurped down his coffee. it was steaming hot, but he didn't care.
Then he just started running. No sooner than he had gotten a block down the
street, however, he was vaporized along with the rest of the midwestern
United States.

The United States responded to the great Midwest Vaporization by
planting wheat, corn, and mango seeds across the land to honor
the lives lost.
